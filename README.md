# odin-rock-paper-scissors
## Background
This is an implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors project from The Odin Project. Using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, I implemented game logic and a UI to display your score against a computer. With adjustable rounds, optional tie option, and visual progression, this game is simple and customizable. 

I learned more on psuedo-elements and global variables in CSS, event listeners in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and basic UI principles.

## UI Demonstration

## Progress
### First Phase
The first phase of the project was to code the game logic so adding functions to getComputerChoice(), selecting a random choice, initialize game, updateScores(), etc. This was all tested in the terminal on blank html file. 
### Second Phase
The second phase of the project had us create a UI for the game logic, displaying how many points each player had, showing clickable buttons to make player selection, and showing round results. I went for a neon aesthetic and had hover and click events displaying what the player was choosing. At the bottom I decided to show the computer choice and a text describing the round outcome. The score is above showing how many points the player and the computer has respectively with a gradient, moving border. 
### Third Phase
The third phase was personalizing this project in any way I saw fit. I added a settings cog button at the top right which would show a modal. The player has the option to increase the score required to win with a max of 25 and a min of 1. The player can also choose to allow ties (default is true) during the game to speed progression.
